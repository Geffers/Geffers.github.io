## Welcome to Geffer's Github Pages

**Raspberry Pi - the computer not the pudding.  This will be a selection of simple script files to maintain or enhance
your favourite SBC**

Your Raspberry Pi is like a family pet, so many projects, some headless, some with Desktop, this site will offer some simple
tasks to automate function, for example,  many headless systems would benefit from having a Desktop GUI on occasions and VNC access
but both of these take up resources.  It is very easy to start in Terminal Mode, enable the Desktop and VNC, do what you need to do then
shut down those services again.

**Pi 1 runs off an attached powered HD**

I own a Pi 1 (Original Chinese example), only 256MB memory, it runs headless and offers various server functions  I was trying to get Xsane to offer scanning over the network but needed a Desktop to simplify setup.  A Pi 1 running a desktop, perfectly adequate for what I needed then shut down Desktop GUI and
the VNC server.  I did increase the swapfile to 512MB. The Pi uses the SD card merely to boot, the operating system is on an attached powered hard drive.

### What do I use my various Pi devices for?

- Pi-Hole (ad blocker)
- Personal VPN
- Web Server (Apache2)
- Media Server (MiniDLNA)
- Xsane scanner server
- Mumble VOIP server
- Kodi
- TVHeadend client and server (enable TV to stream via ethernet, saves extension antenna cable)
- ADS-B receiver for aircraft tracking - Feeds Flightaware, FlightRadar24 and ADSBExchange.
