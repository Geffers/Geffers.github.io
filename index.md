**Raspberry Pi - the computer not the pudding.  This will be a selection of simple script files to maintain or enhance
your favourite SBC**

Your Raspberry Pi is like a family pet, so many projects, some headless, some with Desktop, this site will offer some simple
tasks to automate function, for example.  Many headless systems would benefit from having a Desktop GUI on occasions and VNC access
but both of these take up resources.  It is very easy to start in Terminal Mode, enable the Desktop and VNC, do what you need to do then
shut down those services again.

I recently had a Pi 1 (Original Chinese examle), it runs headless and offers various server functions, trying to get Xsane to offer scanning
over the network needed a Desktop to simplify setup.  I Pi 1 running a desktop, perfectly adequate for what I needed then shut down Desktop GUI and
the VNC server.

### What do I use my Pi for?

- Web Server
- Media Server
- Xsane scanner server
- Mumble VOIP server
- Kodi
- TVHeadend client and server (enable TV to stream via ethernet, saves extension antenna cable)
- ADS-B receiver for aircraft tracking
