This is merely an introduction to some scripts that are useful to me when experimenting with my Raspberry Pi devices.

Nothing special, installs a minimal desktop GUI to an original LITE installation.  This has the advantage that it can run via terminal so economic 
on resourses but the VNC server and Desktop can be started via terminal then disabled after use.

Aircraft tracking via ADS-B is a fascinating hobby too, easily run on a Pi Zero unless you have additional databases and visual charts installed.
